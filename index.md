Elevations.Rmd ([rmd](https://github.com/ocean-satellite-tools/alaska-maps/blob/main/Elevations.Rmd)   [view](https://raw.githack.com/ocean-satellite-tools/alaska-maps/master/Elevations.html)) shows how to create this map using just the raster and tmap packages. All the spatial data is also from those packages. You don't need to download any extra files. The Rmd file alson includes an example (at the bottom) of adding an inset to show the study location within Alaska.
